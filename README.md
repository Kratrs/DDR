Change log:
Background image added. This is only a place holder. Also made the floor class invisible so if you're moving down and wondering why you stopped its because of that.
To make it visible again just uncomment it in its' drawObject function.
Change log:
Sprite Class, TimeKeeper Class.
There is now time keeping of the game and there is also now animation for the sprites. The sprites will flip horizontally depending on the direction faced.
